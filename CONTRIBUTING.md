## Formatting Guidelines
- Methods should follow PascalFormat
- Try to use `var` where ever possible

## Notes
- Do not forget to lock threads that are reading or writing from the same variables

## Creating a Pull Request
1. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
2. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!
