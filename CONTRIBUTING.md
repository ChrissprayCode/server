## Setup
.NET is installed from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0 (cross platform) or with Visual Studio if you check the `.NET desktop environment` workload when installing.

### Public JWT Key
Copy the `public.key` which was created from the [web server](https://github.com/Kittens-Rise-Up/website) and paste it in `obj\Debug\net5.0` (if you don't see these folders you need to run the project at least once with `dotnet run`)

Run the project with `dotnet run`
